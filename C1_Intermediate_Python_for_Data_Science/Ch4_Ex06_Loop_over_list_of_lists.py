# Exercise:

# Remember the house variable from the Intro to Python course? Have a look at its definition on the right. It's
# basically a list of lists, where each sublist contains the name and area of a room in your house.

# It's up to you to build a for loop from scratch this time!


# Instructions:

# Write a for loop that goes through each sublist of house and prints out the x is y sqm, where x is the name of the
# room and y is the area of the room.


# Code:

# house list of lists
house = [["hallway", 11.25],
         ["kitchen", 18.0],
         ["living room", 20.0],
         ["bedroom", 10.75],
         ["bathroom", 9.50]]

# Build a for loop from scratch
for room in house:
    print('the {} is {} sqm'.format(room[0], room[1]))
